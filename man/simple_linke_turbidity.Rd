\title{Simple Linke Turbidity Model}
\usage{
simple_linke_turbidity(
  time,
  location_type = c("rural", "clean_rural", "urban", "polluted"),
  seasonal_variation = TRUE,
  hemisphere = c("north", "south")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{Timestamps as POSIXct, POSIXlt, character, or numeric}

\item{location_type}{Character string describing location:
\itemize{
\item "clean_rural": Very clean, rural areas (TL = 2.0-3.0)
\item "rural": Clean rural areas (TL = 3.0-4.0)
\item "urban": Urban/suburban areas (TL = 4.0-5.0)
\item "polluted": Polluted urban areas (TL = 5.0-6.0)
Default: "rural"
}}

\item{seasonal_variation}{Logical. Apply simple seasonal variation (+/- 0.5).
Higher turbidity in summer (local), lower in winter. Default: TRUE}

\item{hemisphere}{Character string: "north" or "south". Used only if
seasonal_variation is TRUE. Default: "north"}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of Linke turbidity values
}
\description{
Provide simple Linke turbidity estimates based on month and location type.
This is a simplified approximation. For more accurate values, use site-specific
measurements or climatological databases.
}
\details{
This function provides rough estimates only. For research-grade work, use:
\itemize{
\item Direct measurements from sun photometers
\item Climatological databases (e.g., SoDa Linke turbidity database)
\item Site-specific historical data
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
time <- seq(as.POSIXct("2026-01-15 00:00", tz = "UTC"),
            by = "month", length.out = 12)

tl <- simple_linke_turbidity(time, location_type = "rural", hemisphere = "south")
}
